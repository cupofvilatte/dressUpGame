# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This project is a dress-up game designed to help me learn the basics of game development using Python and PyGame. The goal is to create a simple, interactive experience that allows users to drag and drop clothing items onto a character.

In this game, players can select various clothing items and accessories to dress up a character by dragging and dropping them into place. The game supports basic interaction through mouse input, and the visuals are displayed in a graphical interface.

The purpose of this software is to gain experience with PyGame, practice working with graphics and user input, and develop a better understanding of how to structure game projects.

{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
